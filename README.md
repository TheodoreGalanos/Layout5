### Prerequisites:

Follow the instructions here:
https://github.com/mcneel/compute.rhino3d/blob/master/docs/deploy.md

Install Python on the remote server. Your best shot is Anaconda:

Make sure you have the following Grasshopper plugins installed (also on the compute server - get them from Food4Rhino):
